# First Whitelist Project

This is the whitelist contract for the free mint NFT project that will give access to Cool DAO

## More Details

- This project is a full stack web application built using JavaScript, Next.js, Hardhat, Solidity, and Ethers@5. The purpose of the application is to allow users to interact with a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. 

- The front-end of the application is built using Next.js, which provides server-side rendering and allows for easy integration with the Ethereum blockchain through Ethers.js.

- The back-end of the application is built using Solidity, which is a programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and is managed using the Hardhat development environment.

- Ethers@5 is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions. The application allows users to connect their Ethereum wallets and view their balances, as well as deposit and withdraw funds from the DeFi protocol.
